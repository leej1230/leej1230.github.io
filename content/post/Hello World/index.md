## Hello World!

This will be my first time making a page using Hugo.  
I used to have my own personal blog by using Wordpress.  
However, I decided use Github Pages to write my blogs.  
Main reason for this is that I love to experience new thing. I love to experience or learn new stuffs to expand my skills and knowledge.  
Second reason is that I had to pay for using Wordpress but not Github Pages.ðŸ˜›

I will move my past blogs into this place and I am planning to update this blog at least once a month so that I can share what I have learned. (I like to output things that I learned)

Tune in next time!
